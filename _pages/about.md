My name is Nirvan Silswal and I'm currently a Senior at Duke studying CS & Statistics. I have an interest building machine learning paradigms modeled after the human brain, and am interested in Computational Neuroscience.

Welcome to my personal website, where I've included current and past projects I've worked on alongside descriptions of my experience. Feel free to send me an email at nirvan.silswal@duke.edu if you have any questions! I also use this site as a personal blog of sorts, where I highlight things I find interesting under Ephemera.

I'm currently a member of the Topological Learning Lab at Duke, you can check the lab out here: https://www.topo-learn.com/
