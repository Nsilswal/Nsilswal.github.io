## Overview

In a hybrid work environment, it’s often hard to establish open lines of communication and keep team morale high. SlackWrapped is like Spotify Wrapped but for team-wide Slack superlatives! By giving each slack channel interesting and unique analytics SlackWrapped enables coworkers to establish more personable connections while having light-hearted fun at work.

## Features

- Provides metrics such as: yearly summaries of most popular emojis, most positive users, most common phrases, team member who sends the most messages, channel best friends, member who double texts the most often, most ghosted, and the wildest emoji in the channel
- SlackWrapped utilizes advanced machine learning models such as BERT and NLTK to analyze message sentiment
- Scrapes entire slack channel to generate metrics

## Built With

- Python
- Slack Bot API
- BERT & NLTK

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- This project was part of a company wide hackathon so I’m unable to share code, but essentially you would start a bolt server on your laptop and then add the slackbot to your channel. The slackbot would listen for the /wrapped command and return with the slack wrapped report for the channel

## Roadmap

- The plan was to add the slack bot to every channel across the company so that we could perform user testing however, onboarding a slackbot to the actual company workspace requires lots of approval from higher ups - so we were unable to perform the tests.
